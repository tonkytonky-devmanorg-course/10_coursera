courses from Coursera. For each course it will get its name, taught language, 
the number of weeks it lasts and its average user rating.

The output will be written to a specified XLSX file. 


# Usage

coursera.py [-n NUMBER] path
```
`path` - path to output file  
`-n NUMBER` - number of courses to get
